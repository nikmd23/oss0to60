					<aside class="notes">
                        <p>My name is Nik Molnar. I live in NYC. I've been a web dev for a little over 16 years. I cofounded Glimpse</p>
					    <p>
					        What is the Glimpse project?
					        <ul>
					            <li>Started to scratch an itch</li>
					            <li>Gained popularity very quickly with a little help from a Hanselbump</li>
					            <li>100K downloads and counting, a little over 40 contributors</li>
                                <li>Full time sponsorship from Redgate software to continue with its development</li>
					        </ul>
					    </p>
					    <p>So yes, I work on OSS for a living, but that does not mean I have all the answers. I'm trying to find my way like everyone else.</p>
					    <p>That's the reason that I created this presentation. This is what I wish I had two years ago when we were starting Glimpse. Once again, I'm trying to scratch an itch</p>
					    <p>A lot of the content has been learned the hard way, by first hand experience. Other parts of the content we were lucky enough to learn from those that came before us, and I've captured the best of that I've learned from others in the past two years as well.</p>
                        <hr/>
                        <p>That learning starts with Bruce Wayne Tuckman.</p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        <p>Bruce <strong>Wayne</strong> Tuckman is a researcher in the theory of group dynamics and Professor Emeritus at Ohio State University</p>
                        <p>In 1965 he published a theory called "Tuckman's Stages"</p>
                        <p>Tuckman proposed that there are four necessary and inevitable phases in order for a team to grow, to face up to challenges, to tackle problems, to find solutions, to plan work, and to deliver results</p>
                        <p>
                            Those phases are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Forming - the period in which a team comes together</li>
                                <li>Storming - the phase when a team runs into inevitable challenges</li>
                                <li>Norming - the phase when a team understands the plan and can execute on it</li>
                                <li>Performing - the phase when individuals on the can begin to anticipate each other</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>OSS is special because the team is constantly churning - so there are always people in each of these stages.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <p>Let's explore each of these in more detail...</p>

                            <p>I've pulled together three points to consider while forming, and perhaps the most important one for an OSS project is the thing that makes a project OSS in the first place: it's license</p>

                        <h2>Select a License</h2>

                        <img src="img/licenses.png" class="plain" />

                        <h4><a href="http://www.tldrlegal.com/">tl;dr Legal</a> to the rescue!</h4>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            <p>Selecting a license can be daunting. (Probably best not to create your own!) But it is important to set the tone for how the project can be distributed ASAP.</p>
                            <p>Contributors and users may be attracted (or repeled) to a project based on it's license. So choose carefully based on your target audience</p>
                            <p><strong>Story Time</strong> For the 1st release of Glimpse we chose a Creative Commons license - simply because we didn't know any better and they had a nice license landing page.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, as Phil Haack pointed out to us, CC licenses are better suited for content, and he suggested we take a look at the Apache 2 license.</p>
                            <p>To figure out which license is right for you, be sure to select one from <a href="http://opensource.org/">OpenSouce.org</a> since their licenses all comply with the <a href="http://opensource.org/osd">Open Source Definition</a>, which defines 10 tenants of a truly open source license.</p>
                            <p>tldrlegal.com really comes in handy for gaining a quick overview of a licenses and for comparing a license</p>
                            <p><strong>Demo Apache 2 on tldrlegal</strong></p>
                            <hr/>
                            <p>Contributors License Agreements are another type of license you may want to consider for your project.</p>
                            <p>CLA's are agreements that contributors to a project sign turning over their copy write to the project</p>
                            <p>If you are asked to sign one, do not be alarmed - they are fairly common</p>
                            <p>Glimpse has one, also at the suggestion of Phil Haack and it has served as well since Redgate asked about copy write when they sponsored the project</p>
                            <p>CLA's are less organized/categorized than standard licenses, but typically come in flavors for individuals and corporations</p>
                            <p>Try to use a CLA template like the one available from the Apache Foundation to simplify the process for contributors.</p>
                            <hr/>
                            <p>Once licensing has been figured out, there are some fairly standard tasks that need to be completed</p>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            <p>OSS projects need a website. Websites provide a lot more info than just what your repository or package feed can cover.</p>
                            <p><strong>Story time</strong> We learned this lesson the hard way from Scott Hanselman, who demanded that we have a website for Glimpse before he would blog about it. I stayed up until 4:00 AM cranking out the 1st Glimpse website on Tumblr.</p>
                            <p>The website is often the first impression that a user has of the project, so take some care to get a decent template. It can be simple, but should be pleasant to use.</p>
                            <p>As a user should feel free provide feedback on the website as well. Often the website is open source itself so it can be contributed to.</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p>Mission statement/readme.md that expresses the goals of the project and what it will/won't do</p>
                            <p>scriptcs has a nice simple mission statement: <q>scriptcs makes it easy to write and execute C# with a simple text editor</q>. It's concise and to the point.</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p>Contributor guidelines should be available to to inform developers how to get the source, build the source and submit pull requests. Be sure to cover any conventions or standards used within the project.</p>
                            <p>If your looking to contribute to a project - be sure to look for this!</p>
                            <p>Contributor guidelines are so important to open source that GitHub has <a href="https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines">built in support for them</a> via the contributing.md file</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p>Demo/screenshots have always been a recommended best practice for commercial projects, and the same holds true for OSS</p>
                            <p><strong>Story time</strong> The 4:00 AM YouTube video of Glimpse had 50K views and dramatically helped people grok the concept behind glimpse</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p>Forkability, a term coined by Karl Fogel of the SVN project, is the ease of which a developer <em>could</em> fork the project.  Forkability also makes it easy for them to grab the code, build it and get started.</p>
                            <p>Some companies wearing the fact that they can get a new hire to deploy to production on their first day on the job as a badge of honor. How long does it take to get a new contributor up and running in a OSS project is a measure of its forkability.</p>
                            <p>To make a codebase forkable:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Keep as many dependencies in source control/package restore as possible</li>
                                <li>Single command build process</li>
                                <li>Built in samples</li>
                                <li>Developer documentation</li>
                                <li>Forkability helps to ensure distributed leadership</li>
                            </ul>
                            <hr />
                            <p>Because a fork could produce a pull request or a competitor - forkability keeps maintainers honest and working for the good of the project</p>
                            <p>Honesty and transparency are also fundamental tenants of governance models</p>

                            <del>Contributors should get acquainted with the governance model and try to act accordingly</del>
                            <p>Defining a governance models for a project is important to help orient users with the way to interact with given project's community</p>
                            <p>There are many different governance models, mostly ad hoc, and two particularly famous ones: benevolent dictator and meritocratic method</p>
                            <p>Benevolent dictator is the model that Linus Torvolds and the Linux team leverage. I personally am not a huge fan of this model, but it clearly does work</p>
                            <p>For today I am going to focus on the meritocratic method, because that's the one I have experience with</p>
                            <p>I though I knew what the meritocratic method was since so many project claim that they work in tht model - but I was shocked to find that there is well written governance documents by OSS-Watch which explains all the ins and outs in full details</p>
                            <p>I'm going to quickly recap by covering the Roles and decision making process</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p><strong>Users</strong> are people who actually need the project. They are the most important members of the community and without them the project would have no purpose. Obviously anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements. Users provide feedback, word of mouth evangelism, moral and sometimes financial support.</p>
                            <p><strong>Contributors</strong> are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project. Anyone can become a contributor, and contributions can take many forms such as support, reporting bugs, identifying requirements, providing graphics and web design, writing documentation, fixing bugs, adding features</p>
                            <p><strong>Committers</strong> are community members who have shown that they are committed to the continued development of the project through ongoing engagement with the community. Committership allows contributors to more easily carry on with their project related activities by giving them direct access to the project's resources. That is, they can make changes directly to project outputs, without having to submit changes via patches. A committer seeks approval after the contribution is made, rather than before. They must be nominated.</p>
                            <p><strong>Reviewers</strong> consists of those individuals identified as "project owners". The reviewers have additional responsibilities over and above those of a committer. These responsibilities ensure the smooth running of the project. Reviewers are expected to review code contributions, participate in strategic planning, approve changes to the governance model and manage the copyrights within the project outputs. They must be nominated.</p>

                            <p>It should be no surprise to see the communications is the first challenge to discuss within OSS projects.</p>
                            <p>Good and proper communication is the most important part of managing an OSS project. Lack of good communication can cause a project to break down and lose contributors. Communications can be broken into three channels.</p>

                                example of this could include surveys to determine how well a part of your community
                                is working.</p>
                            <p><strong>Outgoing</strong> to blogs and social media. Sharing news, stories, and achievements from the community with the rest of the world.
                                An example of this could be showing off something your community has created.</p>
                            <p><strong>Internal</strong> with HipChat, Trello and Skype should be used sparingly. Internal discussions and meetings in the community to discuss objectives, goals, conflict,
                                and other issues. An example of this could include meetings that are designed to decide
                                how your community will work together toward its goals.</p>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            <p>In his 1957 book <em>Parkinson's Law, and Other Studies in Administration</em>, Cyril Northcote Parkinson introduced "Parkinson's law of triviality" which states:</p>
                            <p><strong>the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Story Time</strong>Parkinson dramatizes this law with the example of a committee's deliberations on building an atomic power plant, contrasting it to deliberations on building a bicycle shed.</p>
                            <p>The reason this happens is because people want to prove that they are involved and to "put their fingerprints on something" so that one day they can walk by and say "I built that".</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately whats really happening is that the community is toiling in minor issues while there are larger, higher priority problems to tackle</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p>In 1999 Poul-Henning Kamp applied Parkinson's law to the OSS FreeBSD project in an email to the projects mailing list. He said:</p>
                            <p>"Why Should I Care What Color the Bikeshed Is? The really, really short answer is that you should not. The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one just because you do not like the color they plan to paint it. This is a metaphor indicating that you need not argue about every little feature just because you know enough to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change."</p>
                            <p>Kamp's email is available at bikeshed.com - send it to the member of your community and make them aware of the concept and your desire to avoid it. Encourage them to point out the behavior when they see it as well.</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p>Besides communication challenges OSS projects face many of the same challenges as marriages and other relationships. We all know that finances can put huge stress on a marriage - the same goes for OSS projects.</p>

                            <p>Finances can be the biggest cause of strain on any relationship, including the relationship between an open source team.</p>
                            <p>We were lucky with Glimpse because we were tested with money very early on.</p>
                            <p><strong>Story Time</strong>At Mix we were offered 10K to close and sell the source, which forced us to evaluate why we really did Glimpse.</p>

                            <p>On the other side of the spectrum, some projects can't stay afloat because their maintainers can't afford to pay any bills that may be associated with the project. If you enjoy using an OSS product, and don't have the time to get involved in the effort, consider donating $$.</p>
                            <p>Check to make sure they have a plan for the cash first, to avoid the situation that Jeff Atwood had with his 5K donation to screwturn wiki</p>

                            <p>Congrats - you have a new baby boy for a project. You're so proud, people are using it and it's going to be awesome.</p>
                            <p>People use this analogy of the "parents" of a project. And children can be a real joy and sense of pride in a parents life.</p>
                            <p>But along with that pride and joy comes dirty diapers and a lot of work.</p>
                            <p>With OSS there is a lot of pressure to fix bugs, support users, grow community, make it better, etc</p>
                            <p>What makes it worse is that the number of issues in a project's bug tracker grows in proportion to the number of people using the software. Therefore, even as you fix bugs and ship an increasingly robust program, you should still expect the number of open issues to grow essentially without bound.</p>
                            <p>I wrestled mightily with this. Working all weekend to ensure I didn't miss a "deadline". Making sure there was a plan to fix everybug. Answering every support question that came in. Crying myself to sleep.</p>
                            <p>I don't have a clever well thought out approach or tip here. I'm just being honest and wanted to leave you with encouragement.</p>
                            <p>I just want to remind you that OSS isn't life. There are more important things out there. Don't take yourself so seriously. Remember why you started OSS in the first place.</p>

                            <del>Contributors and users should try to not pull the team off their goals too much. Be mindful of support requests. Give back the help you receive.</del>
                            <p>Once the project has gotten setup and gone through its first round of problems, the software will be the easy part, getting people aligned and "herding cats" is the challenge</p>
                            <p>First, you'll want to treat every user as a potential volunteer. String them along the process building an on ramp for them if possible.</p>

                            <p>To manage the community, you want to keep in mind two things: focus and attention</p>
                            <p>Focus the community to be working on the task at hand. Defining milestones helps with this.</p>
                            <p>Bring attention to the focused efforts of the community. We like to do this with town hall meetings on Google Hangouts where we ask contributors to show off their recent work</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p>Meeting in person, or less so on Skype, also really strengthens a community. There is something about breaking bread together and sharing a few drinks that really helps the bonding process</p>
                            <p><strong>Story Time</strong> We met a user in Brussels recently - he had never contributed to an OSS project before. But after a few hours and lots of laughs we had built up a repore that continues virtually over the internet now. He's quickly becoming one of our top contributors within a short time span.</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p>Another nice thing about the norming phase is that once a project is decently established, it can usually begin to enjoy some of the perks that are provided by vendors in the industry</p>

                            <del>Contributors should pay attention to these mechanism - if they aren't forced upon them</del>
                            <p>Managing your project and the project's community takes time. Lot's of time. Simplify your life and let the robots help you</p>
                            <p>This is where perks really start to shine: enforce build and test procedures with a CI server</p>
                            <p>Enforce style and naming conventions automatically instead of with a document via tools like StyleCop</p>
                            <p>Auto test pull requests and leverage <a href="https://github.com/blog/1227-commit-status-api">GitHub's commit status API</a> - built into TeamCity and TravisCI</p>
                            <p><strong>Story Time</strong> Story of how user's automatically fix pull requests now without our involvement</p>
                            <p>Automation can also be as simple as opening up your documentation contribution process. We leverage Glimpse's GitHub wiki repo as a subrepo on the website to allow users to directly contribute docs without the need for a pull request. Documentation contributions have tripled since we've done this.</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p>Automation is great, but thinking about contributions and new contributors can also really increase performance.</p>

                            <p><strong>Story Time</strong> Story of users saying that they didn't have enough breath to add a new feature or enough depth to fix a bug, which is how this was inspired</p>

                                Help new contributors by setting up Jump In tags on issues that typically:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Take no longer than a few nights worth of work to implement.</li>
                                    <li>Be relatively standalone, not requiring tight integration with other in development backlog items.</li>
                                    <li>Be well described with pointers to help the implementer.</li>                                
                                    <li>They are not:</li>
                                    <li>Items that the “core team” does not want to implement themselves.</li>
                                    <li>Items that are specifically set aside for junior/novice developers.</li>
                                    <li>Used as a hazing activity for “rookies”.</li>
                                    <li>Designed to be fizzbuzz tests.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>If you are new to a project and looking for ways to contribute, ask if they have any Jump In tasks for you</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p>Thank contributors as loudly as possible</p>
                            <p>In the same vein to make things easier for new contributors, thanks those who have completed work as loudly as possible</p>

                            <p>So this is what I've learned after two years of day in day out experience, and by reading as much about and talking to as many people about these issues as I could.</p>
                            <p>In closing, I wanted to leave you with this inspiring picture of Henry Ford and Thomas Edison together, with Ford's words:</p>
