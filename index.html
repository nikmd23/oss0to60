		<meta name="description" content="Glimpse, an open source web application diagnostics tool, went from a rough back-of-a-napkin idea to a project with tens of thousands of users and developer media attention within a period of eight weeks.Join Glimpse’s co-founder, Nik Molnar, for an honestly raw tale of the pains and lessons learned that arose managing an open source project. Along the way, Nik will cover the tools and techniques that have proven successful over the past two years developing Glimpse, focusing on technical challenges and best practices for community management, communications and open source/life balance.This session is suitable for founders, maintainers, contributors and all users of open source software and aims to spark conversation around the best way to foster open source and open source etiquette.">

                        <img src="img/licenses.png" class="plain" />

                        <h4><a href="http://www.tldrlegal.com/">tl;dr Legal</a> to the rescue!</h4>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Selecting a license can be daunting. (Probably best not to create your own!) But it is important to set the tone for how the project can be used ASAP.</li>
                                <li>1st release of Glimpse we chose a Creative Commons license - simply because we didn't know any better and they had a nice license landing page.</li>
                                <li>Unfortunatly, as Phil Haack pointed out to us, CC licenses are better suited for content, and he sugested we take a look at Apache 2.</li>
                                <li>To figure out which license is right for you, be sure to select one from opensouce.org since their licenses all comply with the Open Source Definition.</li>
                                <li>tldrlegal.com really comes in handy for gaining a quick overview of a licenses and for comparing a license</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Contributors License Agreements are another type of license you may want to consider for your project.</li>
                                <li>CLA's are agreements that contributors to a project sign turning over their copywrite to the project</li>
                                <li>If you are asked to sign one, do not be alarmed - they are fairly common</li>
                                <li>Glimpse has one, also at the suggestion of Phil Haack and it has served as well since RedGate asked about copywrite when they sponsored the project</li>
                                <li>CLA's are less organized/categorized than standard licenses, but typically come in flavors for individuals and corporations</li>
                                <li>Try to use a CLA template like the one available from the Apache Foundation to simplify the process for contributors.</li>

                             <p>OSS is built by humans, and as humans we will have conflicts. Ideas begin to compete with each other. Personalities (and egos!) begin to battle. Architectural challenges and bugs begin to crop up</p>

                            <p>The storming stage is necessary for the growth of the project. It can be contentious, unpleasant and painful, but projects that make it past this stage come out stronger.</p>

                                <li>In his 1957 book <em>Parkinson's Law, and Other Studies in Administration</em>, Cyril Northcote Parkinson introduced "Parkinson's law of triviality" which states:</li>
                                <li>the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change</li>
                                <li>Parkinson dramatizes this law with the example of a committee's deliberations on building an atomic reactor, contrasting it to deliberations on building a bicycle shed.</li>
                                <li>In 1999 Poul-Henning Kamp applied Parkinson's law to the OSS FreeBSD project in an email to the projects mailing list. He said:</li>
                                <li>"Why Should I Care What Color the Bikeshed Is? The really, really short answer is that you should not. The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one just because you do not like the color they plan to paint it. This is a metaphor indicating that you need not argue about every little feature just because you know enough to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change."</li>
