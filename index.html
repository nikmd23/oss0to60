		<meta name="description" content="Glimpse, an open source web application diagnostics tool, went from a rough back-of-a-napkin idea to a project with tens of thousands of users and developer media attention within a period of eight weeks.Join Glimpse’s co-founder, Nik Molnar, for an honestly raw tale of the pains and lessons learned that arose managing an open source project. Along the way, Nik will cover the tools and techniques that have proven successful over the past two years developing Glimpse, focusing on technical challenges and best practices for community management, communications and open source/life balance.This session is suitable for founders, maintainers, contributors and all users of open source software and aims to spark conversation around the best way to foster open source and open source etiquette.">

                        <p>In 1965 Bruce <strong>Wayne</strong> Tuckman, a Professor Emeritus at Ohio State University and a researcher in the theory of group dynamics, published a theory called "Tuckman's Stages"</p>

                        <p>Tuckman proposed that these phases are all necessary and inevitable in order for the team to grow, to face up to challenges, to tackle problems, to find solutions, to plan work, and to deliver results</p>
                        <p>OSS is special because the team is constantly churning - so there are always people in each of these stages.</p>

                        <h2>Select a License</h2>

                        <img src="img/licenses.png" class="plain" />

                        <h4><a href="http://www.tldrlegal.com/">tl;dr Legal</a> to the rescue!</h4>

                        <aside class="notes">
                            <p>Selecting a license can be daunting. (Probably best not to create your own!) But it is important to set the tone for how the project can be used ASAP.</p>
                            <p>1st release of Glimpse we chose a Creative Commons license - simply because we didn't know any better and they had a nice license landing page.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, as Phil Haack pointed out to us, CC licenses are better suited for content, and he suggested we take a look at Apache 2.</p>
                            <p>To figure out which license is right for you, be sure to select one from opensouce.org since their licenses all comply with the Open Source Definition.</p>
                            <p>tldrlegal.com really comes in handy for gaining a quick overview of a licenses and for comparing a license</p>
                            <hr/>
                            <p>Contributors License Agreements are another type of license you may want to consider for your project.</p>
                            <p>CLA's are agreements that contributors to a project sign turning over their copy write to the project</p>
                            <p>If you are asked to sign one, do not be alarmed - they are fairly common</p>
                            <p>Glimpse has one, also at the suggestion of Phil Haack and it has served as well since Redgate asked about copy write when they sponsored the project</p>
                            <p>CLA's are less organized/categorized than standard licenses, but typically come in flavors for individuals and corporations</p>
                            <p>Try to use a CLA template like the one available from the Apache Foundation to simplify the process for contributors.</p>

                                <li>Defining a governance models for a project is important to help orient users with the way to interact with given project</li>
                                <li>There are many different governance models, mostly ad hoc, and two particularly famous ones: benevolent dictator and meritocratic method</li>
                                <li>Beneveloent dictator is the model that Linus Torvolds and the Linux team leverage. I personally am not a huge fan of this model, but it clearly does work</li>
                                <li>For today I am going to focus on the meritocratic method, because thats the one I have experience with</li>
                                <li>I though I knew what the meritocratic method was since so many project claim that they work in tht model - but I was shocked to find that there is well written governance documents by OSS-Watch which explains all the ins and outs in full details</li>
                                <li>I'm going to quickly recap by covering the Roles and decision making process</li>
                            </ul>
                            Roles:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most important members of the community and without them the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements. Users provide feedback, word of mouth evengelism, moral and sometimes financial support.</li>
                                <li>Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project. Anyone can become a contributor, and contributions can take many forms such as support, reporting bugs, identifying requirements, providing graphics and web design, writing documentation, fixing bugs, adding features</li>
                                <li>Committers are community members who have shown that they are committed to the continued development of the project through ongoing engagement with the community. Committership allows contributors to more easily carry on with their project related activities by giving them direct access to the project’s resources. That is, they can make changes directly to project outputs, without having to submit changes via patches. A committer seeks approval after the contribution is made, rather than before. They must be nominated.</li>
                                <li>Reviewers consists of those individuals identified as ‘project owners’. The reviewers have additional responsibilities over and above those of a committer. These responsibilities ensure the smooth running of the project. Reviewers are expected to review code contributions, participate in strategic planning, approve changes to the governance model and manage the copyrights within the project outputs. They must be nominated.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>A meritocracy is not a democracy; that is, not everyone has a binding vote. Only those who have earned it through positive contribution to the project have a binding vote.</p>
                            <p>There are a ful set of rules for which decisions require which type of vote when a concensus can't be naturally acheived - check them out on OSS Watch</p>

                            <p>Good and proper communication is the most important part of managing an OSS project. Lack of good communication can cause a project to break down and lose contributors. Communications can be broken into three channels.</p>

                            <p><strong>Incoming</strong> from Forums, Mailing Lists, Issue Trackers, etc. Receiving and processing feedback and viewpoints for the purpose of improvement. An
                                example of this could include surveys to determine how well a part of your community
                                is working.</p>
                            <p><strong>Outgoing</strong> to blogs and social media. Sharing news, stories, and achievements from the community with the rest of the world.
                                An example of this could be showing off something your community has created.</p>
                            <p><strong>Internal</strong> with HipChat, Trello and Skype should be used sparingly. Internal discussions and meetings in the community to discuss objectives, goals, conflict,
                                and other issues. An example of this could include meetings that are designed to decide
                                how your community will work together toward its goals.</p>

                            <p>In his 1957 book <em>Parkinson's Law, and Other Studies in Administration</em>, Cyril Northcote Parkinson introduced "Parkinson's law of triviality" which states:</p>
                            <p>the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change</p>
                            <p>Parkinson dramatizes this law with the example of a committee's deliberations on building an atomic reactor, contrasting it to deliberations on building a bicycle shed.</p>
                            <p>In 1999 Poul-Henning Kamp applied Parkinson's law to the OSS FreeBSD project in an email to the projects mailing list. He said:</p>
                            <p>"Why Should I Care What Color the Bikeshed Is? The really, really short answer is that you should not. The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one just because you do not like the color they plan to paint it. This is a metaphor indicating that you need not argue about every little feature just because you know enough to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change."</p>

                                I don't have a clever well thought out approach here. I'm just being honest and wanted to leave you with encouragment.

                                The number of issues in a project's bug tracker grows in proportion to the number of people using the
                                software. Therefore, even as you fix bugs and ship an increasingly robust program, you should still
                                expect the number of open issues to grow essentially without bound.
                                
                                What does it mean to miss a deadline?
                            </del>

                            <p>Congrats - you have a new baby boy for a project. You're so proud, people are using it and it's going to be awesome.</p>
                            <p>People use this analogy of the "parents" of a project, and there is a lot of pressure to fix bugs, support users, grow community, make it better, etc</p>
                            <p>I just want to remind you that OSS isn't life. There are more important things out there. Don't take yourself so seriously.</p>
